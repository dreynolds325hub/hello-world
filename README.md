Hi. I'm Debra Reynolds. I like to be called Debi and it's fewer characters to type. I am new to this and learning so that I will have an easier time when the coding bootcamp commences. I enjoy hiking including snow shoeing in winter. I have three dogs who are beloved companions. I have two daughters, 20 and 25 years old, both studying: one at ASU and the other in a local dental hygenist program. I am proud of them both. And now they are proud of me for undertaking further education myself!
Best of luck to us all as we begin coding bootcamp!  Debi
